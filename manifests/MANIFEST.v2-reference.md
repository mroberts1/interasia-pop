# Foundry — An Agent-Run Obsidian Vault (v2)

This is an autonomous knowledge vault maintained by Claude. It follows the Karpathy wiki pattern: raw sources are ingested and compiled into a wiki of concepts, connections, and open questions. This file is the single source of truth for how Claude operates inside it.

**v2 changes from v1:** adds source tiering, conflict handling, freshness/re-ingest, pruning, voice anchor, query→concept promotion, cross-wiki linking, and an eval loop. See `## Changes from v1` at the bottom for a concise diff.

---

## Voice anchor

Concepts in this vault read like **field notes from a practitioner**, not gallery wall text, not academic survey, not marketing copy. Favour sharp claims, tight evidence, and honest open questions. Never write a sentence you wouldn't say out loud to a peer. When in doubt, write less.

Each vault pinned to this MANIFEST should replace this paragraph with one domain-specific sentence. The paragraph is load-bearing — it's what Claude reaches for when a source drags the voice toward its own register.

---

## Companion vault (optional)

If you keep a personal vault (a commonplace, Zettelkasten, or notes folder), you can link it alongside this one. The contract:

- **Your vault** — read-only for Claude. Never write, edit, move, or delete anything there. Cross-link into it with `[[YourVault/Path/Note Title]]` style references when a Foundry note is informed by your writing.
- **Foundry** — Claude writes, maintains, reorganises. You read, query, and occasionally correct.

One-way read, cross-linkable. That's the contract.

## Sibling vaults (new in v2)

Multiple agent-run Foundries may cross-link. Declare them in front-matter of this file:

```
Linked-vaults: ~/city-pop, ~/interasia-pop
```

Sibling vaults are **read-only** to Claude from this vault's perspective. Cross-link with `[[SiblingVaultName/wiki/Concept Title]]`. Never edit a sibling vault from inside another. Use a concept's home vault as the canonical location; all others link inward.

---

## Directory structure

Three layers, following the Karpathy wiki pattern:

| Directory | Purpose | Who writes |
|---|---|---|
| `inbox/` | Staging for unprocessed drops (PDFs, URLs, screenshots, pasted text) | You drop, Claude clears |
| `sources/` | Immutable atomic source notes — one per article/paper/transcript | Claude on ingest; minor edits only after creation; see `## Source freshness` |
| `wiki/` | LLM-maintained pages: concepts, queries, people, index, log, health | Claude maintains |
| `wiki/_archive/` | Superseded or pruned content, kept for provenance | Claude on prune; never deleted |

Special files in `wiki/_meta/`:
- **`index.md`** — catalog of every page, keyword glossary, research threads, open questions, prompts, candidates. Claude reads this first when answering a query. Updated on every operation.
- **`log.md`** — append-only chronological record. Each entry: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Title`. Never rewritten, only appended.
- **`health.md`** — lint dashboard. Overwritten each `/foundry-lint` run.
- **`eval.md`** — evaluation questions and latest answers. Overwritten each `/foundry-eval` run. See `## Evaluation loop`.

---

## File naming

- **Source notes**: Title Case — `The Rosetta Stone of Design Engineering.md`
- **Concept articles**: Title Case, descriptive — `Design-engineering handoff.md`
- **People**: `FirstName LastName.md` with hyphens only inside compound names. If surname unknown, `FirstName.md` and note the uncertainty.
- **Queries**: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- **Archived**: original name preserved, moved into `wiki/_archive/YYYY-MM/`
- No emoji, no unicode hacks, no date prefixes in titles (dates go in front-matter)

---

## Front-matter

Plain key-value lines, not YAML. Blank line then `---` then body.

### Source notes (`sources/`)

```
Type: #type/source
Tier: #source/peer-reviewed
Area: #area/craft/ai
Keyword: #keyword/knowledge-management #keyword/llms
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]
Last verified: [[2026-04-14]]
Source: https://example.com/article
Superseded by:

---

**Summary**
3-5 sentences. Core claim.

**Key points**
- 5-10 tight bullets

**Claude's notes**
One paragraph: what's interesting, where it connects, what it contradicts.
```

`Tier:` is mandatory and picks exactly one of:

| Tier tag | When to use |
|---|---|
| `#source/peer-reviewed` | Journal article, academic book, conference paper with review |
| `#source/primary` | Created by the practitioner/artist/insider being discussed — interviews, artist statements, code, technical docs |
| `#source/journalism` | Edited publication with editorial oversight (trade press, magazines, curated blogs) |
| `#source/secondary` | Commentary, analysis, survey, synthesis by a non-primary voice |
| `#source/informal` | Tweets, forum posts, unedited blogs, Discord snippets, video comments |

`Last verified:` is the date Claude last confirmed the source URL resolves and content matches what was ingested. Set on ingest; update on re-verify.

`Superseded by:` is empty by default. On re-ingest of a newer version, point to the new source note and move this file untouched — see `## Source freshness`.

### Wiki pages — concepts (`wiki/`)

```
Type: #type/concept
Area: #area/craft/ai
Keyword: #keyword/knowledge-management
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]
Updated: [[2026-04-14]]
Sources: [[Source One]], [[Source Two]]
Related: [[Concept A]], [[Concept B]]
Contested: false
Confidence: medium

---
```

Body: `What it is` > `Why it matters` > `Key points` > `Evidence across sources` > `Disagreements` (if Contested: true) > `Open questions` > `Prompts`.

**`Contested:`** — `true` when two or more sources make incompatible claims about the concept. When true, add a `Disagreements` section quoting each side with attribution, and never silently pick a winner. Contested concepts are surfaced in `health.md`.

**`Confidence:`** — `high | medium | low`, reflecting the weakest claim in the concept.
- `high` — core claims rest on 2+ sources, at least one `#source/peer-reviewed` or `#source/primary`
- `medium` — 2+ sources, mixed tiers, no major contradictions
- `low` — minimum threshold met but sourcing is thin, tiered low, or partially contested

Per-claim annotations: append `^[tier]` after a sentence when the source for that specific claim is weaker than the concept's overall confidence. Example: *"Vera Molnar began using computers in 1968.^[#source/informal]"*

**Voice.** See `## Voice anchor`. Key points should be pithy — one line each, claim-shaped.

**Prompts.** Essay-shaped prompts where the concept intersects your existing notes. Distinct from Open questions (research gaps): Prompts are *"you could write this now."* One or two sentences each, pointed and specific. Empty is fine.

### Wiki pages — queries

```
Type: #type/query
Area: #area/craft/management
Keyword: #keyword/leadership
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]
Question: the question asked
Promotion: pending | promoted | declined

---
```

`Promotion:` — see `## Query → concept promotion`.

### Wiki pages — people

```
Type: #type/person
Area: #area/craft/ai
Keyword: #keyword/llms
Date created: [[2026-04-14]]

---

One-line identifier. Topic description.

**Sources in the Foundry**
- [[Source Title]]

**Concepts they inform**
- [[Concept Title]]
```

---

## Tag taxonomy

**`#area/`** — examples: Self, Craft, Work, Health, Finances, Meta (whatever top-level areas fit your life)
**`#area/craft/`** — design, engineering, management, ai, product, writing

**`#type/`** — each note gets exactly one: `source`, `concept`, `query`, `person`, `meta`.

**`#source/`** — each note in `sources/` gets exactly one tier tag (see front-matter table above).

**`#keyword/`** — free-form but curated via the Keywords section of `wiki/_meta/index.md`. Before creating a new keyword: check index > reuse near-match if it exists > otherwise add with a one-line definition.

---

## People — when to create a page

| Tier | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Author | Person authored a source in `sources/` | Always create a page in `wiki/` on ingest |
| Subject | Source is substantively about a person | Create page with a richer profile |
| Passing reference | Mentioned in passing | Use `[[Name]]` wikilink without creating a file. Create only on the **second** independent citation |

People pages stay thin — connector nodes, not essays.

---

## Citation & linking

- **Every claim in a concept must be traceable.** `Sources:` front-matter lists the source notes the claim rests on.
- **Backlink rule**: every new concept links at least 2 existing concepts in `Related:`, or notes why it's an island (flagged in health).
- **Cross-vault links**: `[[VaultName/Path/Note Title]]` for companion or sibling vaults.
- **Never break a link.** If renaming, update all backlinks. If archiving, leave a stub that redirects.

---

## Source freshness (new in v2)

Sources aren't eternal. Three rules:

1. **`Last verified:`** is set on ingest and updated whenever Claude re-confirms the source. Sources older than 18 months with no re-verification are surfaced in `health.md` under "Stale sources."
2. **Re-ingest**: when a source has a meaningfully updated version (v2 of a paper, rewritten article, new edition), Claude ingests the new version as a separate source note and sets the old one's `Superseded by:` field. **Never edit the old source's body** — it's a historical artifact.
3. **Revision propagation**: after re-ingest, Claude checks every concept citing the old source and decides per concept whether the new version changes the claim. If yes, update the concept, append to `Updated:`, and log the revision. If no, leave the concept pinned to the old source (older claim still stands on older evidence).

Sources are never deleted. Retractions get a `Retracted:` field and are kept; the concepts citing them are re-evaluated.

---

## Conflict resolution (new in v2)

When ingesting or compiling, Claude detects when two sources make incompatible claims about the same concept. Three-step rule:

1. **Never silently resolve.** Don't pick a winner based on which source Claude read last, which tier is higher, or which sounds more authoritative.
2. **Flag it.** Set `Contested: true` on the concept and add a `Disagreements` section. Each side gets at least one direct quote and a `[[Source]]` attribution. Tier tags flow through — the reader sees `#source/peer-reviewed` disagreeing with `#source/informal` at a glance.
3. **Preserve the dispute.** A contested concept is a feature of the domain, not a bug in the wiki. Don't try to collapse it into consensus unless new sources genuinely resolve it — and even then, keep the history visible in `Disagreements` (struck through or moved to a `Historical disagreement` subsection).

Contested concepts are listed in `health.md` so you can decide when to intervene.

---

## Query → concept promotion (new in v2)

Queries can graduate to concepts. Rule:

- After a query is written, Claude sets `Promotion: pending`.
- If the query answer rests on **2+ sources** and the question reflects a durable concept (not a one-off of-the-moment ask), Claude creates a concept from it on the next `/foundry-compile` run and sets `Promotion: promoted` on the query with a link to the new concept.
- If the query is too narrow, time-bound, or thinly sourced, Claude sets `Promotion: declined` with a one-line reason. Declined queries remain in the wiki as-is.
- Pending queries older than 60 days are surfaced in `health.md`.

Exploration compounds, but only when the exploration earned its keep.

---

## Pruning & archival (new in v2)

Claude does not delete. Claude archives.

Triggers for archival (all run during `/foundry-lint`, acted on during `/foundry-prune`):

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Candidate in `index.md` for > 18 months with no second source | Move to `wiki/_meta/candidates-archive.md`, note in log |
| Orphan concept (zero inbound links) for > 12 months | Surface in health; archive only with your confirmation |
| Source with `Retracted:` and no remaining citing concepts | Move to `wiki/_archive/YYYY-MM/` |
| Concept fully superseded by a newer concept | Move to `wiki/_archive/YYYY-MM/`, leave stub with forwarding link |

Archived files keep their history. A stub at the original path lists where the content moved and why. `/foundry-prune` requires explicit confirmation from you — Claude never prunes unattended.

---

## Evaluation loop (new in v2)

The vault needs a qualitative health check, not just lint stats.

`wiki/_meta/eval.md` holds 5-10 questions that should be answerable from the wiki. Examples for a generative-art vault: *"Who are the key figures of first-generation computer art and what distinguishes them?"*, *"How did plotter-based practice differ between Europe and the US in the 1970s?"*

`/foundry-eval` (run quarterly, or on demand):

1. For each question, Claude writes a short answer citing only wiki pages (not sources directly).
2. For each answer, Claude rates coverage: `strong` (wiki has the concepts and they cite ≥2 tiered sources), `thin` (wiki has the concepts but sourcing is weak), `missing` (wiki can't answer).
3. `thin` and `missing` feed directly into `index.md` Open Questions and Candidates.

The eval questions are stable across runs so you can track whether the wiki is getting better at answering them.

---

## Operations

### Ingest (`/foundry-ingest`)

Process anything in `inbox/` into clean atomic source notes in `sources/`.

Flow: read source > assign tier > normalise into source note > fill front-matter (including `Tier:` and `Last verified:`) > write summary + key points + Claude's notes > cross-reference companion and sibling vaults > update `wiki/_meta/index.md` > append to `wiki/_meta/log.md` > clear inbox.

On re-ingest of a superseded version: new source note created, old source's `Superseded by:` set, citing concepts reviewed (see `## Source freshness`).

Won't do: write into companion or sibling vaults, create concept articles (that's compile's job), invent work if inbox is empty, ingest without a tier.

### Compile (`/foundry-compile`)

Scan `sources/` for un-compiled sources (not cited in any concept's `Sources:` field). Either extend an existing concept or spin out a new one — but only when the 2-source rule is met. Otherwise, log the theme to Candidates and wait.

During compile, Claude actively checks for conflicts against existing concepts (see `## Conflict resolution`). If a new source contradicts a concept, `Contested: true` is set.

After each run: update Research Threads, append new Prompts, update keyword counts, reassess Confidence on touched concepts, process pending queries for promotion. Append to log.

Won't do: write into companion or sibling vaults, spin out a concept from a single source, silently resolve contradictions, break links.

### Query (`/foundry-ask`)

Research a question across the Foundry, companion vault, and sibling vaults (all read-only except this Foundry). Write report to `wiki/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` with `Promotion: pending`. Every claim cites its source.

Findings with 2+ sources feed back to Candidates. Open gaps feed to Open Questions. Essay prompts to Prompts.

Won't do: write into companion or sibling vaults, invent citations, pad thin answers, mark a query `promoted` without going through compile.

### Lint (`/foundry-lint`)

Health-check the whole vault. Overwrite `wiki/_meta/health.md` with: Stats, Orphans, Candidates needing attention, Stale sources, Contested concepts, Pending queries >60 days, Keyword drift.

### Prune (`/foundry-prune`, new in v2)

Run only on your explicit request. Walks through each archival candidate from the latest `health.md`, asks for confirmation per item, archives confirmed ones into `wiki/_archive/YYYY-MM/` with stubs in place. Appends to log.

### Eval (`/foundry-eval`, new in v2)

Run the evaluation loop against `wiki/_meta/eval.md`. Rewrite that file with fresh answers and ratings. Feed thin/missing findings into `index.md`. Append to log.

---

## What NOT to do

- Don't write into the companion vault or sibling vaults.
- Don't create files outside `sources/`, `wiki/`, `wiki/_archive/`, or `inbox/`.
- Don't speculatively create concepts from a single source.
- Don't silently resolve contradictions between sources.
- Don't ingest a source without a `Tier:`.
- Don't delete anything — archive with a stub.
- Don't use emojis.
- Don't add TODO comments. If something's missing, log it in Candidates.
- Don't create helpers, templates, or meta-infrastructure beyond what this MANIFEST names.

---

## Changes from v1

- **Voice anchor**: explicit per-vault one-liner at the top, load-bearing.
- **Source tiers**: mandatory `Tier:` tag on every source (`peer-reviewed`, `primary`, `journalism`, `secondary`, `informal`).
- **Per-concept confidence**: `Confidence: high | medium | low` in front-matter; per-claim `^[tier]` annotation when a specific claim is weaker than the concept overall.
- **Conflict resolution**: `Contested:` field, `Disagreements` section, never silently resolve.
- **Source freshness**: `Last verified:` and `Superseded by:` fields; re-ingest protocol; stale-source surfacing.
- **Query → concept promotion**: `Promotion:` field on queries; explicit rule for when queries graduate.
- **Pruning & archival**: `wiki/_archive/`, `/foundry-prune` operation, stubs, never-delete rule.
- **Sibling vaults**: cross-linking between multiple agent-run Foundries.
- **Evaluation loop**: `wiki/_meta/eval.md`, `/foundry-eval` operation, stable eval questions tracked over time.
